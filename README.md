Prothon
=======
 Welcome to Prothon program version 1.1 !


1) Main feature :

Prothon is a primality proving program for specific classes of Proth numbers .
Proth numbers are numbers of the form N=k*2^n+1 , with k odd and k<2^n .
Prothon can test for primality following classes of Proth numbers :

Class 1 :

N=k*2^n+1 , with n>2 , k<2^n and

k= 5,19 (mod 42) with n= 0 (mod 3)

k= 13,41 (mod 42) with n= 1 (mod 3)

k= 17,31 (mod 42) with n= 2 (mod 3)

k= 23,37 (mod 42) with n= 0,1 (mod 3)

k= 11,25 (mod 42) with n= 0,2 (mod 3)

k= 1,29 (mod 42) with n= 1,2 (mod 3)

Class 2 :

N=k*2^n+1 , with n>2 , k<2^n and

k= 1 (mod 6) and k= 1,7 (mod 10) with n= 0 (mod 4)

k= 5 (mod 6) and k= 1,3 (mod 10) with n= 1 (mod 4)

k= 1 (mod 6) and k= 3,9 (mod 10) with n= 2 (mod 4)

k= 5 (mod 6) and k= 7,9 (mod 10) with n= 3 (mod 4)


2) Basic Algorithms :

Numbers are tested using Lucasian primality algorithms ,

Happy testing !!!
